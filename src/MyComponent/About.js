                Because React-Bootstrap doesn't depend on a very precise version of Bootstrap, we don't ship with any included CSS. However, some stylesheet is required to use these components.

                CSS#How and which Bootstrap styles you include is up to you, but the simplest way is to include the latest styles from the CDN. A little more information about the benefits of using a CDN can be found here.

        </div>
    )
}
